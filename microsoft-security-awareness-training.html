    <p><a href="http://www.atrevido.net/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=256b6bb4-f6f4-43a5-985b-7fe5796b809c">This</a>
is just too funny to pass&nbsp;up.  </p>
<p>So far, <a href="http://windowssecrets.com/050127/#story1">malware&#8217;s winning the war of
attrition</a>.  </p>
<p>Well, at least <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx">Microsoft
Anti-Spyware</a>
is going to be&nbsp;free.  </p>
<p>Too bad there&#8217;s already <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,119641,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">malware which targets
it</a>.  </p>
<p>You do have a real hardware firewall, don&#8217;t you? If not, there&#8217;s no
reason why you shouldn&#8217;t &#8212; here&#8217;s my <a href="http://insecure.ucdavis.edu/OpenBSD/openbrick">OpenBSD
recipe</a> that works
beautifully on inexpensive hardware, and has big-bucks features like
stateful filtering, source tracking, bandwidth queuing, <span class="caps">NAT</span>, <span class="caps">OS</span>
detection, adaptive state table timeouts, <span class="caps">MAC</span> address tagging (with
brconfig), macros and tables, and hardware failover capability. All for
the price of an <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html">OpenBSD <span class="caps">CD</span></a> and
whatever hardware you run it&nbsp;on.  </p>
<p>(One of the firewalls I set up for a class C network was a Pentium 166
with <span class="caps">32MB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span>, and it mostly sat at 99% idle filtering a <span class="caps">100MB</span>
full-duplex <span class="caps">LAN</span>. OpenBSD has a very efficient network stack. When I&#8217;ve
gone around to help setup OpenBSD firewalls for departments at <span class="caps">UC</span> Davis,
we mostly recycle leftover desktops that have been&nbsp;replaced.)  </p>
<p>Of course, to help deal with malware you&#8217;ll also have to do egress
filtering (not just ingress filtering, where most rulesets stop), and as
always, keep your systems&nbsp;patched.  </p>
<p>But then, there&#8217;s no such thing as a&nbsp;panacea.  </p>
<p>Did I also mention that pf rules are nearly&nbsp;plain-language?  </p>
