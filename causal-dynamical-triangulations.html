  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Rajesh Kommu and <a href="http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/Text/Carlip.html">Professor Steve
Carlip</a> are working on
interesting ways to model quantum gravity using computational methods.
Rajesh has been kind enough to help show me where to get&nbsp;started:  </p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/0105/0105267v1.pdf">Dynamically Triangulating Lorentzian Quantum&nbsp;Gravity</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/0002/0002050v3.pdf">A non-perturbative Lorentzian path integral for&nbsp;gravity</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/0011/0011276v2.pdf">Non-perturbative 3d Lorentzian Quantum&nbsp;Gravity</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/0505/0505113v2.pdf">Spectral Dimension of the&nbsp;Universe</a>  </p>
<p>As things often do, it turns into code, which Rajesh has again&nbsp;provided.  </p>
<p>Of course, Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 has some &#8230; issues with the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2006/08/02/686894.aspx"><span class="caps">STL</span></a>.  </p>
<p>So, in the interest of getting working code I&#8217;ll try a virtual instance
of Ubuntu which I should be able to
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading">upgrade</a> later when 7.10
comes out later this&nbsp;month).  </p>
<p><a href="http://register.vmware.com/content/download.html">VMWare</a> server
requires <span class="caps">IIS7</span>, so here&#8217;s the instructions for <a href="http://www.iis.net/articles/view.aspx/IIS7/Deploy-an-IIS7-Server/Installing-IIS7/Install-IIS7-on-Vista">installing <span class="caps">IIS7</span> on
Vista</a>.  </p>
<p>Except that I couldn&#8217;t connect to my own VMWare server, and apparently
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kdente/archive/2007/03/14/vmware-on-vista-lameness.aspx">VMWare has issues on
Vista</a>
&#8230;&nbsp;sigh.  </p>
<p>Okay, it seems to be a <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-1375">driver signing
issue</a>.  </p>
<p>Meh &#8230; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual <span class="caps">PC</span>
2007</a>
will probably suffice for my purposes. I&#8217;ll keep <span class="caps">IIS7</span>.0 anyways for when
I install Visual Studio 2008 Release Candidate and want to develop
against <span class="caps">IIS</span>.  </p>
<p>&#8230; Except that Virtual <span class="caps">PC</span> 2007 apparently doesn&#8217;t know how to handle
Ubuntu. Just hangs at the nice pretty install screen, wasting <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;cycles.  </p>
<p>Back to VMWare server. Looks like I can disable driver signing
permanently using an admin&nbsp;console:  </p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new;">bcdedit.exe /set
nointegritychecks <span class="caps">ON</span><br />
bcdedit -set loadoptions&nbsp;\DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS  </p>
<p></span>Let&#8217;s try this&nbsp;again.  </p>
<p>Hmmm, that *still* didn&#8217;t disable driver signing. So, bootup using F8,
disable driver&nbsp;signing.  </p>
<p>Now install VMWare Server 1.04. This time, I&#8217;ll pick a slimmer linux
distribution, like <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>.  </p>
<p>I have to admit, nice, slick, easy install. Not as fast as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>&#8216;s bare-bones, efficient text setup,
but it&#8217;s pretty, and more importantly, it works (unlike the heavier
Ubuntu desktop I just&nbsp;tried).  </p>
<p>Now install VMTools. Oh, it&#8217;s an rpm. Fortunately, there are ways to
<a href="https://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/23/installing-using-an-rpm-file/">install using an <span class="caps">RPM</span>
file</a>.  </p>
<p>Hmmm. Should I be surprised that this didn&#8217;t work? Okay, back to
installing a&nbsp;tarball.  </p>
<p>That worked, even though it also overwrote pre-existing stuff from the
<span class="caps">RPM</span>.  </p>
<p>Actually, no it didn&#8217;t. It just stopped VMWare from nagging that VMTools
isn&#8217;t installed. I&#8217;ll just deal with the mouse capture for now, because
this really all is besides the point. (Note to self: more empathy for
people just trying to get their work done using&nbsp;computers.)  </p>
<p>Some things never change. Xubuntu has 84 updates to&nbsp;patch!  </p>
<p>Well, the whole point of this was to compile this under Linux (where
Rajesh wrote it) instead of tailchasing Visual Studio 2008/C++ <span class="caps">STL</span>
issues. Almost there! Now to find a decent <span class="caps">IDE</span>.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard good things about Eclipse, but I don&#8217;t really want to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EclipseWebTools">unpack
Java, install Tomcat, Web
Tools</a>, etc. etc.
when I don&#8217;t plan to do any web development. I just want the C/C++&nbsp;portion.  </p>
<p>Ah, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/CDT"><span class="caps">CDT</span></a> looks like what I want.
Is the magic incantation&nbsp;really:  </p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new;"># sudo apt-get
install</span><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy-backports/devel/eclipse-cdt"><span
style="font-family: courier new;">eclipse-cdt</span></a><span
style="font-family: courier new;"><br />
# sudo apt-get install&nbsp;eclipse</span>  </p>
<p>Wow, looks like it is! Now to see if Rajesh&#8217; <span class="caps">CDT</span> code compiles&nbsp;&#8230;.  </p>
<p>Okay, right now Eclipse is a tad confusing. And again, learning Eclipse
isn&#8217;t the&nbsp;point.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to that old standby,&nbsp;vi.  </p>
<p>Sure helps to have a c++ compiler&nbsp;installed  </p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new;"># sudo apt-get install&nbsp;g++</span>  </p>
<p>Well, okay, looks like I&#8217;m missing some other files. Make doesn&#8217;t know
how to make cdtworks. A structural&nbsp;issue.  </p>
<p>So, when something fails, try something else&nbsp;&#8230;  </p>
<p>Made some more progress on the Windows <span class="caps">VC</span>++ 9 version. Turns out, even
though the project files were stored in my C:\Projects file, Visual
Studio had other ideas, and expected everything to be stored in the
Visual Studio default file path. I&#8217;ll just leave that one, since the
default file path ends up getting stored on our <span class="caps">SAN</span>, whereas I&#8217;ve had
the most lovely fun with hard drives and Bitlocker (which is again,
besides the&nbsp;point).  </p>
<p>Almost complies, although <span class="caps">VC</span>++ wants all header file declarations in
stdfx.h. Just missing one file &#8230;&nbsp;again!  </p>
<p>On the other hand, now I can read code in two OSes. Sure is interesting
dereferencing all those&nbsp;pointers!  </p>
<p>Quantizing spacetime is fun,&nbsp;though!</p>
