And again, it's been quite awhile.

Mostly, I've been busy the past year getting serious about doing my research. [My project][1] was recently accepted by the [Mozilla Science Lab][1], a really cool effort which aims to harness open-source software towards basic research.

However, as I type this I am sitting here at Hebrew University, in sunny (but chilly, at least by a Californian's standards) Jerusalem attending the [32nd Winter School in Theoretical Physics on 100 Years of General Relativity: From Theory to Experiment and Back][3]. I'm having a blast getting my brain filled!

This post is really a placeholder; I expect to be adding pictures and links to material soon.

At any event, Shalom and Happy New Year!
