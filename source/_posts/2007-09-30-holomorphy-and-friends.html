I'm reading Chapter 8 of <a href="http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/modernsusy/index.html">Modern Supersymmetry</a>.<br /><br />To understand the first sentence, I had to review Maldacena's <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9711/9711200v3.pdf">paper</a>, which (not-so) incidentally proposed the AdS/CFT correspondence (hence its numerous <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2006/alltime.shtml">citations</a>).<br /><br />Hmmm. I'll have to read it again. ;-) But moving on ...<br /><br />Okay, now need to review <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9905/9905111v3.pdf">non-renormalization theorems</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9802/9802109v2.pdf">Wilsonian effective action</a>.<br /><br />Wow, lots to catchup!</div>
