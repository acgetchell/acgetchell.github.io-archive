The first paper I read for Causal Dynamical Triangulations is a fairly steep introduction (for me), so I went and looked over the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805108">2D</a> case and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9806241">lessons</a>, as well as a general <a href="http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-1998-13/">review</a> of methods.<br /><br />I'm also looking at <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SAGE</a>, Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation, a free mathematical programming system using <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> + a lot of open source tools. On Windows, SAGE  <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/SAGEbin/microsoft_windows/README.txt">requires</a> <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMWare</a> and uses firefox. You can use it <a href="https://sage.math.washington.edu:8103/login">online</a>, but so far it's rather slow, and appears to have been <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/07/12/08/1350258.shtml">slashdotted</a>.<br /><br />Impressive tool! Feels a lot like Mathematica, accessible via web browser. The <a href="http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/doc/html/tut/tut.html">tutorial</a> is well-worth running through (I used the on-line version while upgrading my local install, but the local version allows you to run the calculation cells using Shift-Enter ).<br /><br />For example, SAGE extends Python to handle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29">rings</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number">p-adic</a> numbers (which I learned, should always have a prime number base to avoid the zero-divisor problem).<br /><br />Adding dvipng SAGE package requires adding ghostscript, via apt-get install gs.<br />Also requires libkpathsea, which requires tetex via apt-get install tetex-extra<br /><br />PostScript: the SAGE dvipng package doesn't work, but apt-get install dvipng puts dvipng on the system, which should suffice.<br /><br />Note: SAGE runs on Edgy, and can be updated to Feisty by using update-manager-core as described <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading">here</a>. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">SAGE-support</a> group is available on Google Groups.<br /><br />PostScript: SAGE can be upgraded to Gutsy, I used the Upgrade Manager available in Xubuntu (I wanted a GUI for some SAGE file management via apt-get install xubuntu-desktop)<br /><br />Doesn't work yet on BSD, alas, and running a SAGE server has security implications.</div>
