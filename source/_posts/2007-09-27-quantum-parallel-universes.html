Professor Andy Albrecht has kindly pointed me to one of a series of papers by David Deutsch that begins the proof of Hugh Everett's <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/">Many-World's Hypothesis</a>:<br /><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/9906/9906015.pdf">Quantum Theory of Probability and Decisions</a><br /><br />This paper removes the requirement to have a probabilistic<br />interpretation of quantum mechanics, instead casting it into a<br />non-probabilistic decision theory basis.<br /><br />The main result is that the usual probabilistic formulation can be<br />replaced by a rational decision maker using classic decision theory.<br />Furthermore (and most importantly), quantum processes whose outcomes<br />look stochastic can be replaced by deterministic evolution of states.<br /><br />Note that this neatly removes the issues around definitions of probability in the MWI.<br /><br />I'm now taking, for fun, an advanced <a href="http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/modernsusy/index.html">Supersymmetry</a> <a href="http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/teaching/246B/index.php">class</a>, taught by Prof. John Terning, which picks up where my last SUSY class left off. Wow, I need to <a href="http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/teaching/246/index.php">review</a>!</div>
