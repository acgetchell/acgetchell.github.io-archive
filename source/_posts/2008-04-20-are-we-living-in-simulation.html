Today I came across one of Dr. Nick Bostrom's <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">existential philosophy papers</a> regarding life vs. sim-life (aka are we living in the Matrix?).<br /><br />To me, the really interesting question is the assumption of substrate-independence (because I don't believe we're living in a simulation, more on that in a bit) -- that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">sentience</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience">sapience</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a> can arise from any appropriately complex material, including computer processors. Is there some minimal complexity bound for intelligence? (First, tell me what you mean by <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/iq.pdf">intelligence</a>.) On one hand, we already know that a virus is just a particular aggregation of molecules, and that any assemblage of those particular atoms will exhibit the same viral behavior. On the other, does that extend to a connection between viruses and the rest of the living world, and by analogy, to bottom-up intelligence?<br /><br />Will computers be able to exhibit sentience, sapience, or self-awareness?<br /><br />As an aside, although most people seem to know Seth Lloyd's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908043">paper</a> on the ultimate limits of computing, I tend to prefer Warren D. Smith's <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/fundphys.ps">Fundamental Physical Limits on Computation</a> and <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/memorybound.ps">Fundamental physical limits on information storage</a> as being more useful equation-wise (and he has very interesting papers on <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/jcj.pdf">election systems</a> and <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/multisurv.pdf">voting</a>, which doesn't surprise me when it concludes that our current voting system is nearly the worst mathematically possible, and that<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/naturebees.pdf"> Range Voting</a> is a much better <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/SSpf.pdf">algorithm</a>).<br /><br />(Note that some the papers are in PS format, so you will need a PostScript reader such as <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/get49.htm">GSview</a> along with <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">GPL Ghostscript</a> to read.)<br /><br />Before I get too sidetracked, let me outline my reasoning for why I don't believe we're living in a simulation:<br /><br /><ul><li>The total entropy/information of our Universe is bounded at <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0801/0801.1847v1.pdf">&lt; 10E123</a> (due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">Holographic principle</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>A simple quantum computer with 500 entangled pairs generates more information than could be simulated by any non-quantum computer in this Universe (2^500 &gt;&gt; 10E123)</li></ul><ul><li>If the Universe is not simulated to a quantum degree of accuracy, the simulation can be immediately exposed via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell's inequality</a></li></ul><ul><li>Thus, in order to create a virtual universe sufficient to withstand experimental quantum physics tests, you need 10E123 qubits (e.g., the Universe)</li></ul><br />Anyways, this is a very interesting  topic, but I should continue my sidetracking avoidance and get back to my research.</div>

Clay,<BR/><BR/>I've adjusted my comments about Range Voting (though it really doesn't change the overall conclusion).<BR/><BR/>However, I don't think you're understanding the argument with respect to Bell's theorem, so let me lay it out.<BR/><BR/>Quantum mechanics (and Quantum Field Theory) describe, not a single theory, but a series of mathematical rules for constructing theories. We choose those rules that reflect our observations.<BR/><BR/>If our current reality were virtualized, that means that the currently indeterminate state vector of a system, say |a>, is actually determined by the physics of the underlying reality running our simulation.<BR/><BR/>This is equivalent to a hidden variable theory. Bell's inequality provides a mathematical restriction on the limits of hidden variable theories, and experimentation has shown that our universe exceeds these limits.<BR/><BR/>Thus,there cannot be an underlying simulation universe that provides hidden inputs to our quantum mechanical state vectors, and that still complies with what we see today.<BR/><BR/>I'll have more to say about this later.</div>

Warren Smith doesn't say that plurality voting is the worst system possible; only that it has a lot of the properties you'd expect if you <EM>were</EM> trying to develop a bad voting method.  There are much worse voting methods.<BR/><BR/>Also, the argument against our being in a simulation because of the amount of information in <EM>n</EM> entangled particles is irrelevant, since if this is a simulation we're living in, we have no idea whether the properties of the "real" world are anything like those of this fake one.<BR/><BR/>Also we don't have a way of even knowing whether we exist at all, thought that's a little more esoteric.<BR/><BR/>Clay Shentrup<BR/>Chief Evangelist<BR/>The Center for Range Voting</div>
