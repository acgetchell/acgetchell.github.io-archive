After a long hiatus, I'm back ...<br /><br />Back to what? Well, most of that hiatus was due to work, and I already keep a (boring) work journal. But the main thing is I'm back to doing physics ...<br /><br />The goal is to start (and finish) a dissertation in Computational Quantum Gravity. What does that mean, exactly? Well, that's the whole point of the journey -- and this blog will help me track my progress. It may not be that interesting to you to read, but it will be useful for me to write, and keep notes, with. And a goal left unstated is left undone -- that's why it's all hanging out here.<br /><br />So the first order of business is to get really <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">comfortable with LaTeX</a>.<br /><br />Next, it would be really nice to be able to post equations here. Oh, looks like someone's already <a href="http://wolverinex02.googlepages.com/emoticonsforblogger2">hacked that together</a>.<br /><br />The Einstein equation:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.forkosh.dreamhost.com/mimetex.cgi?G_%7B%5Calpha%20%5Cbeta%7D%20=%20T_%7B%5Calpha%20%5Cbeta%7D" align="middle" border="0" /><br /><br />Here's a really good intro summary on the state of the art on quantum gravity:<br /><br /><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-gravity/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-gravity/</a><br /><br />With a reference to the classics:<br /><br /><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/einstein/einstein.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/einstein/einstein.html</a><br /><br /><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gr/gr.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gr/gr.html</a><br /><br />Well, that should be enough to start with this weekend!</div>
