So, my colleagues have developed a <a href="http://adamgetchell.blogspot.com/2007_10_01_archive.html">CDT</a> program that's usable. Fortunately for me, it's in LISP, which lacks parallel processing, modern libraries, a nice IDE, and the other goodies I've become accustomed to in my work life. (That means I get to figure these features out and thereby contribute!)<br /><br />Enter Visual Studio 2008, <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/">IronPython</a>, and <a href="http://ironscheme.codeplex.com/">IronScheme</a>.<br /><br />Setting up IronScheme with Visual Studio 2008 was usefully detailed <a href="http://ironscheme.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=IronScheme%20Visual%20Studio%202008%20Integration&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">here</a>: (note, you need <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb707481.aspx">RegPkg</a> via the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=30402623-93ca-479a-867c-04dc45164f5b&amp;displaylang=en">Visual Studio 2008 SDK</a>)<br /><br />Setting up IronPython with Visual Studio 2008 via <a href="http://ironpythonstudio.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8934">IronPython Studio (integrated setup)</a>:<br /><br />And voila, no more excuses to complain about development.<br /><br />(Yes, the end goal is to make it Python and cross-platform, although I'm really eying F#)</div>
