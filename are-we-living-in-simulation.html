  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today I came across one of Dr. Nick Bostrom&#8217;s <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">existential philosophy
papers</a> regarding
life vs. sim-life (aka are we living in the&nbsp;Matrix?).  </p>
<p>To me, the really interesting question is the assumption of
substrate-independence (because I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re living in a
simulation, more on that in a bit) &#8212; that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">sentience</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience">sapience</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a> can arise
from any appropriately complex material, including computer processors.
Is there some minimal complexity bound for intelligence? (First, tell me
what you mean by
<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/iq.pdf">intelligence</a>.) On
one hand, we already know that a virus is just a particular aggregation
of molecules, and that any assemblage of those particular atoms will
exhibit the same viral behavior. On the other, does that extend to a
connection between viruses and the rest of the living world, and by
analogy, to bottom-up&nbsp;intelligence?  </p>
<p>Will computers be able to exhibit sentience, sapience, or&nbsp;self-awareness?  </p>
<p>As an aside, although most people seem to know Seth Lloyd&#8217;s
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908043">paper</a> on the ultimate limits of
computing, I tend to prefer Warren D. Smith&#8217;s <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/fundphys.ps">Fundamental Physical
Limits on
Computation</a> and
<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/memorybound.ps">Fundamental physical limits on information
storage</a> as
being more useful equation-wise (and he has very interesting papers on
<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/jcj.pdf">election systems</a>
and <a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/multisurv.pdf">voting</a>,
which doesn&#8217;t surprise me when it concludes that our current voting
system is nearly the worst mathematically possible, and that<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/naturebees.pdf">Range
Voting</a> is a
much better
<a href="http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/SSpf.pdf">algorithm</a>).  </p>
<p>(Note that some the papers are in <span class="caps">PS</span> format, so you will need a
PostScript reader such as
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/get49.htm">GSview</a> along with
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/"><span class="caps">GPL</span> Ghostscript</a> to&nbsp;read.)  </p>
<p>Before I get too sidetracked, let me outline my reasoning for why I
don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re living in a&nbsp;simulation:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The total entropy/information of our Universe is bounded at <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0801/0801.1847v1.pdf">\&lt;
    10E123</a>
    (due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">Holographic
    principle</a>)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>A simple quantum computer with 500 entangled pairs generates more
    information than could be simulated by any non-quantum computer in
    this Universe (2\^500 >> 10E123)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>If the Universe is not simulated to a quantum degree of accuracy,
    the simulation can be immediately exposed via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell&#8217;s&nbsp;inequality</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Thus, in order to create a virtual universe sufficient to withstand
    experimental quantum physics tests, you need 10E123 qubits (e.g.,
    the&nbsp;Universe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, this is a very interesting topic, but I should continue my
sidetracking avoidance and get back to my&nbsp;research.</p>
