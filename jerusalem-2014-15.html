    <p>And again, it&#8217;s been quite&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>The big news is the welcome addition of Benjamin to our family. You can see him studying with me in my profile picture. He&#8217;s an incredible ball of energy and joy, and there&#8217;s nothing like having him around to remind one of the meaning of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Aside from that, and with Benjamin&#8217;s encouragement, I&#8217;ve been busy the past year getting serious about doing my research. <a href="http://collaborate.mozillascience.org/projects/quantumGravity">My project</a> was recently accepted by the <a href="http://collaborate.mozillascience.org/projects/quantumGravity">Mozilla Science Lab</a>, a really cool effort which aims to harness open-source software towards basic research. This is a part of a general movement, along with &#8220;new&#8221; trends such as <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/">Data Science</a> (themselves based on practices and techniques from <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu">Software Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org">Agile Development</a>, and <a href="http://nosql-database.org">NoSQL</a> to name just a&nbsp;few).</p>
<p>However, as I type this I am sitting here at <a href="http://new.huji.ac.il">Hebrew University</a>, in sunny (but chilly, at least by a Californian&#8217;s standards) Jerusalem attending the <a href="http://www.as.huji.ac.il/schools/phys32">32nd Winter School in Theoretical Physics on 100 Years of General Relativity: From Theory to Experiment and Back</a>. I&#8217;m having a blast getting my brain filled! I will post more about what I&#8217;ve learned&nbsp;later.</p>

<p>(Benjamin is already quite the world traveler, handling planes, trains, and sightseeing with&nbsp;aplomb.)</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve migrated from Octopress to Pelican, as <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/">others have done</a>, for similar reasons. <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2014/07/migrated-to-pelican.html">This post</a> was very helpful in doing the conversion, especially the Blogger support added into pelican-import.py. <a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html">This post</a> helped with the GitHub pages&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Shalom and Happy New&nbsp;Year!</p>
